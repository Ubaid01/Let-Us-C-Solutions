[G] Answer the following: 

(a) What would happen if you try to put so many values into an array when you initialize it that the size of the array is exceeded? 
1. nothing 
2. possible system malfunction (Correct)
3. error message from the compiler 
4. other data may be overwritten 
"Possible system malfunction resulting in garbage value or data overflow"
(b) In an array int arr[12] the word arr represents the a_________ of the array 
"address of the first element of the array"

(c) What would happen if you put too few elements in an array when you initialize it? 
1. nothing 
2. possible system malfunction 
3. error message from the compiler 
4. unused elements will be filled with 0's or garbage (Correct)

(d) What would happen if you assign a value to an element of an array whose subscript exceeds the size of the array? 
1. the element will be set to 0 
2. nothing, it's done all the time 
3. other data may be overwritten 
4. error message from the compiler (Correct)
"But in case of small code in new compilers it can also store that data."

(e) When you pass an array as an argument to a function, what actually gets passed? 
1. address of the array 
2. values of the elements of the array 
3. address of the first element of the array (Correct)
4. number of elements of the array 

(f) Which of these are reasons for using pointers? 
1. To manipulate parts of an array (Correct)
2. To refer to keywords such as for and if
3. To return more than one value from a function 
4. To refer to particular programs more conveniently 
"So that change in array also reflects in main function."

(g) If you don't initialize a static array, what would be the elements set to? 
1. 0 (Correct)
2. an undetermined value 
3. a floating point number 
4. the character constant '\0' 
"For static pre-processor all values will be initialized to 0."

[H] State True or False: 

(a) Address of a floating-point variable is always a whole number.
"False: The address of a floating-point variable is not always a whole number. Addresses in computer memory are typically represented in hexadecimal or binary format, and they are not constrained to being whole numbers. But in C we use unsiigned integer whole number to print it. "

(b) Which of the following is the correct way of declaring a float pointer: 
5. float ptr ; 
6. float *ptr ; (Correct) 
7. *float ptr ; 
8. None of the above 

(c) Add the missing statement for the following program to print 35. 
main( ) 
{ 
 int j, *ptr ; 
 *ptr = 35 ; 
 printf ( "\n%d", j ) ; 
}
"ptr = &j; // Assigning the address of j to ptr
*ptr = 35; // Assigning 35 to the value pointed by ptr (i.e., j)
printf("\n%d", j); // Print the value of j, which is now 35"

(d) if int s[5] is a one-dimensional array of integers, which of the following refers to the third element in the array? 
9. *( s + 2 )  (Correct) Refers to s[2] which is 3rd element.
10. *( s + 3 ) 
11. s + 3 
12. s + 2
