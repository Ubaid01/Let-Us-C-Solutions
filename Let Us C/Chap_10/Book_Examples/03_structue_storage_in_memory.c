//  The architecture of this microprocessor is such that it is able to fetch the data that is present at an address, which is a multiple of four much faster than the data present at any other address. Hence the VC++ compiler aligns every element of a structure at an address that is multiple of four. Thatâ€™s the reason why there were three holes created between the char and the float.  
// All are stored in same memory range i.e. of 4 bytes.  
    return 0;
